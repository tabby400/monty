### STACKS AND QUEUES, LIFO FIFO IN C PROGRAMMING
A stack can be defined as a data structure that has a principle of LIFO whereby the last item to be put on a stack is the first one out. A queue on the other hand is a data structure that follows the principle of FIFO whereby the fist item in is the first item out
